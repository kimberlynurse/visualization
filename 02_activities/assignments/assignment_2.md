# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Good Data Visualization Example - Bar Chart (Vertical):

      This visualization depicts the risk of clinical events with increasing kidney volume in adults. The important data visualization qualities are Aesthetic, Substantive and Perceptual. Overall, this visualization holds all three and can be considered good for the following reasons: 
      1. In terms of aesthetics, the use of white text on a blue background provides good colour contrast and the chart colours correspond to the colour palette of the brand-name medication used to treat ADPKD (see source).
      2. A substantive approach was taken. There is a clear chart title with study details included below. Both axes are labelled and the y-axis scale is interpretable.
      3. In terms of perceptual quality, the key takeaway is included under the title. This reduces the cognitive load and ensures the message can be understood by a wider audience. Data sources are numerically referenced in this digital presentation of the data. Citing sources is best practice as it facilitates reproducibility and suggests transparency and trustworthiness to the audience(provenance rhetoric).
      4. Additionally, the correct visualization was chosen for this data. Bar charts/plots portray the relationship between a numeric and categorical variable, with bar lengths proportional to the numeric value it represents. 
        
      Bad Data Visualization Example - Multiple Series 3D Bar Chart:

      Overall, this visualization does not hold all three important data visualization qualities and can be considered bad for the following reasons:
      1. Although the chart is colourful and aesthetically pleasing, it does not take a substantive approach as it is missing a title and axis labels. The y-axis scale is unclear and the 3D nature of the bars distorts the values being represented. There is also duplication between the z-axis categories and legend. 
      2. In terms of perceptual quality, without title and axis labels it is difficult to ascertain the message. Additionally, there is no source information on the visualization itself, however, after viewing the source linked below, one can see that the title is 'Vehicle Expenses'. The lack of y-axis scale details still leaves the message unclear and increases extraneous cognitive load. 
      3. Additionally, since vehicle expenses generally lack a true 3D structure, the use of a third dimension would not be justified for this visualization. 
      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Although the vertical bar chart is "good" it could be improved by ensuring the included numerical references are available to the public or intended audience and not blocked.

      To ensure the data in the 3D bar chart is accurately and honestly presented, the title should be included, the axis labels clear and the y-axis scale interpretable. Including the title and labels along with a source will assist the audience in understanding the message. Additionally, to accurately compare vehicle expenses and address the use of a third dimension without cause, a stacked or grouped bar chart/plot could be used. Therefore, the visualization would display the value of a numeric variable for each expense category stacked on top of each other or side-by-side and grouped by year.    
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
